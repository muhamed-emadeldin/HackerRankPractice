# Diagonal Difference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

## 1 2 3
## 4 5 6
## 9 8 9  

## The left-to-right diagonal = 15, The right to left diagonal = 17
## Their absolute difference is = 15 - 17 = 2

# How to Solve
# - take a length of list a
# - loop in range n
# - compare between a[i] and b[i]

# Time complexities in worst case: O(n)
# Space complexities in worst case: O(1)
